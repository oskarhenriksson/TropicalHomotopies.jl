# TropicalHomotopies.jl
This project implements a general framework for computing solving polynomial systems numerically, 
based on homotopies constructed from certain tropical stable intersections.

It uses functionality from Oscar.jl and HomotopyContinuation.jl.

The underlying ideas are to be explained in a forthcoming paper with Paul Helminck, Oskar Henriksson, Yue Ren, Benjamin SchrÃ¶ter.

## Installation
The easiest way to get started using the contents of this is to manually download all files, and then run

```
include(TropicalHomotopies.jl)
```
where `TropicalHomotopies.jl` is replaced by the path to the file `TropicalHomotopies.jl`.

## Examples
Consider the following system:
```
Qx, x = polynomial_ring(QQ,"x"=>1:3);
F = [5*x[1]^3*x[2] - 6*x[1]*x[2]^3 + x[1]*x[2], 
    5*x[1]^3*x[2] - 6*x[1]*x[2]^3 - x[1]*x[2]^2,
    x[1]+x[2]+x[3]-2]
```
We can solve it with classical polyhedral homotopies as follows:
```
decomposition = [[f] for f in F]
tropical_solve(decomposition)
```
The underlying stable intersection calculation shows that the mixed volume is 4:
```
tropical_root_bound(decomposition)
```
A sharper bound is obtained as follows:
```
decomposition = linear_and_binomial_part(F)
tropical_root_bound(decomposition)
```
To use the associated generalized polyhedral homotopies to solve the system, we run
```
tropical_solve(decomposition)
```
