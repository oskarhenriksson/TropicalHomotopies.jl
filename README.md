# TropicalHomotopies.jl
This project implements a general framework for computing solving polynomial systems numerically, 
based on homotopies constructed from certain tropical stable intersections.

It uses functionality from Oscar.jl and HomotopyContinuation.jl.

The underlying ideas are to be explained in a forthcoming paper with Paul Helminck, Oskar Henriksson, and Yue Ren.
